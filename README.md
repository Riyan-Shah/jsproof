A set of NFTs is defined and maintained using this JavaScript code. It has three primary functions: getTotalSupply, listNFTs, and mintNFT.

The mintNFT function logs a confirmation message when it adds a new NFT to the NFTs array with the properties (name, eyeColor, shirtType, bling) as requested.
All of the minted NFTs are displayed via the listNFTs function, along with a structured representation of their properties. It notifies the user if no NFTs are generated.
The function getTotalSupply yields and records the total number of NFTs that have been created.
After minting two NFTs, the script lists and displays the total number of NFTs that have been minted, demonstrating its functionality. This configuration provides a fundamental basis for handling NFTs in a JavaScript context.
